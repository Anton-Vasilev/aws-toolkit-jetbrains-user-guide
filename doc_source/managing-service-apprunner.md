# Managing App Runner services<a name="managing-service-apprunner"></a>

After creating an App Runner service, you can manage it by using the AWS Explorer pane to carry out the following activities:
+ [Pausing and resuming App Runner services](#pause-resume-apprunner)
+ [Deploying App Runner services](#deploying-apprunner)
+ [Viewing logs streams for App Runner](#viewing-logs-apprunner)
+ [Deleting App Runner services](#deleting-apprunner)

## Pausing and resuming App Runner services<a name="pause-resume-apprunner"></a>

If you need to disable your web application temporarily and stop the code from running, you can pause your AWS App Runner service\. App Runner reduces the compute capacity for the service to zero\. When you're ready to run your application again, you can resume your App Runner service\. App Runner provisions new compute capacity, deploys your application to it, and runs the application\.

**Important**  
You are billed for App Runner only when it's running\. So pausing and resuming your application helps you manage costs in development and test situations\.<a name="pause-app-runner"></a>

## To pause your App Runner service<a name="pause-app-runner"></a>

1. [Open AWS Explorer](key-tasks.md#key-tasks-open-explorer), if it isn't already open\.

1. Expand **App Runner** to view the list of services\.

1. Right\-click a service that's **Running** and choose **Pause**\.

1. In the dialog box that displays, choose **Pause**\.

   While the service is pausing, the service's status changes from **Operation in progress** to **Paused**\.<a name="pause-app-runner"></a>

## To resume your App Runner service<a name="pause-app-runner"></a>

1. [Open AWS Explorer](key-tasks.md#key-tasks-open-explorer), if it isn't already open\.

1. Expand **App Runner** to view the list of services\.

1. Right\-click a service that's **Paused** and choose **Resume**\.

1. In the dialog box that displays, choose **Resume**\.

   While the service is resuming, the service's status changes to **Operation in progress** and then to **Running**\.

## Deploying App Runner services<a name="deploying-apprunner"></a>

If you choose the manual deployment option for your service, you need to explicitly initiate each deployment to your service\. <a name="deploy-app-runner"></a>

1. [Open AWS Explorer](key-tasks.md#key-tasks-open-explorer), if it isn't already open\.

1. Expand **App Runner** to view the list of services\.

1. Right\-click a service that's **Running** and choose **Deploy**\.

1. While your application is being deployed, the service's status changes from **Operation in progress** and then to **Running**\.

1. To confirm that your application is successfully deployed, right\-click the same service and choose **Copy Service URL**\.

1. To access your deployed web application, paste the copied URL into the address bar of your web browser\.

## Viewing logs streams for App Runner<a name="viewing-logs-apprunner"></a>

CloudWatch Logs allow you to monitor, store, and access your log files for services such as App Runner\. Log events are records of some activity recorded by the application or resource being monitored\. And a log stream is a sequence of log events that share the same source\. 

You can access two types of log stream for App Runner:
+ **Service log streams**: Contains logging output generated by App Runner as it manages your App Runner service and acts on it\.
+ **Application log streams**: Contains the output of your running application code\.<a name="view-logs-apprunner"></a>

1. Expand **App Runner** to view the list of services

1. Right\-click a service and choose one of the following:
   + **View Service Log Streams**
   + **View Application Log Streams**

   The **Log Streams** pane displays the log events that make up the log stream\. 

1. To view more information about a specific event, right\-click it and choose **Export Log Stream**, **Open in Editor** or **Export Log Stream**, **Save to a File**\.

## Deleting App Runner services<a name="deleting-apprunner"></a>

**Important**  
If you delete your App Runner service, it's permanently removed and your stored data is deleted\. If you need to recreate the service, App Runner needs to fetch your source again, and also to build it if it's a code repository\. Your web application gets a new App Runner domain\. <a name="delete-app-runner"></a>

1. [Open AWS Explorer](key-tasks.md#key-tasks-open-explorer), if it isn't already open\.

1. Expand **App Runner** to view the list of services\.

1. Right\-click a service and choose **Delete Service**\.

1. In the confirmation dialog box, type *delete me* and then choose **OK**\.

   The deleted service displays the **Operation in progress** status, and then the service disappears from the list\.
